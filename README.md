# allonz-y.css

This is a CSS file that provides basic typography for any website, especially a website with a lot of text to read. It's based on a few princples of classic design with a modern twist and my own personal preferences.

Basically, it's how I like to read a page online.

There are no colors, fonts, or structure, just margins and sizes to make a generally readable article. I use it as a base and create a separate file for each individual site's styles.

I used Eric Meyer's classic [Reset CSS](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) to reset the basic margins.
